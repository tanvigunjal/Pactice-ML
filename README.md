# Image Classification using ResNet50 Architecture 

# Description :

Image classification is a supervised learning problem. Itâ€™s a process that defines a set of target classes and trains a model to recognize them. Based on this set, the algorithm learns which class the test images belong to, and can predict the correct class of future image inputs, and can even measure how accurate the predictions are. In this project, the model is trained using ResNet architecture on CIFAR-10 dataset.

# Dataset :

CIFAR10 dataset consists of 10 classes with 60000  32x32 colour images.  Each class consists of 6000 images. The dataset is divided into train set (45000), validation set (5000) and test set (10000). Dataset is loaded using PyTorch dataloaders.
